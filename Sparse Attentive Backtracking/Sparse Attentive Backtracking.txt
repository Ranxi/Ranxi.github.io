Introduction
In this paper, they identify another possible role of reminding: to perform credit assignment across long time spans.
associative remainding of past events which may be triggered by the current state and added to it.

Method
Using a SAB-augmented unidirectional LSTM with the memory of every k_att th hidden state from the past,
with a modified hard self-attention mechanism limited to selecting at most k_top memories at every timestep.


Experiments:
These findings support our hypothesis that at any given time step, only a few past events need to be recalled
for the correct prediction of output of the current timestep.
